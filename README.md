E-BRS stands for Ensemble of Boolean Rule Sets.
It is a binary classifier that uses an ensemble of boolean rule sets to improve predictive performance and interpretability (in terms of number of rules and average number of atoms).

## Installation
E-BRS is provided in a python package. You can install the package by running:

> pip install .

inside the directory containing the setup.py file.

## Usage
You can find an example of usage in main.py, where E-BRS is trained with several paramter configurations and tested on the Heart UCI datasets.
