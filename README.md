# E-BRS
E-BRS stands for Ensemble of Boolean Rule Sets. It is a binary classifier that uses an ensemble of boolean rule sets for interpretable classification. A record is predicted to belong to the positive class if there is at least one rule that is true for that record.

## Installation
E-BRS is provided in a python package. You can install the package by running:

> pip install .

inside the directory containing the setup.py file.

## Usage
You can find an example of usage in main.py, where E-BRS is trained with several paramter configurations and tested on the Heart UCI datasets.

## Under work
The code is not definitive, yet.
